# Matrix crate

Advent of Code puzzles frequently feature rectangular ASCII descriptions of inputs.
I have found having a matrix class with quality-of-life features eases solving these
puzzles.  Having decided to solve the 2025 edition using Rust, I wanted something
similar.  The code here is inspired by my previous (unpublished) Kotlin quality-of-life
Matrix classes.  It's also heavily influenced by
[someone else's solution](https://github.com/Daedelus1/RustTensors).

The code is pure safe-rust with zero dependencies.  I make no warranties regarding
the quality of the result, nor its fitness for any given purpose.  I'm uninterested
in pull requests for changes or in bug reports.  Clone it and fix it yourself if you
are so inclined.
